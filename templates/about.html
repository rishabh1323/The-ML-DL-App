                Hey guys, I am Rishabh Dingliwal, currently an undergraduate student at Delhi Technological University. So, about me?
                I love data science and to build solutions that work well on real-life applications. I am also an avid reader and a 
                big fan of astrophysics. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I am fluent in probability, statistics, linear algebra, data analysis, machine learning & deep learning algorithms 
                and much more, but most importantly, I am passionate about the possibilities to an unanswered question. I am curious,
                consistent and love to learn and try out new things.    
            </p>
